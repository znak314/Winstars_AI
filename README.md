# Winstars AI DS internship test
The goal of this test is to evaluate skills and knowledge in Data Science and related fields.
We propose to solve two tasks below that contain the exercises related to Machine Learning,
Computer Vision, NLP, and regular coding

## Task 1. Image classification + OOP
In this task, you need to use a publicly available simple MNIST dataset and build 3 classification
models around it. It should be the following models:
1) Random Forest;
2) Feed-Forward Neural Network;
3) Convolutional Neural Network

## Task 2. Named entity recognition + image classification
In this task, you will work on building your ML pipeline that consists of 2 models responsible for
totally different tasks. The main goal is to understand what the user is asking (NLP) and check if
he is correct or not (Computer Vision).

You will need to:
-  find or collect an animal classification/detection dataset that contains at least 10
classes of animals.
-  train NER model for extracting animal titles from the text. Please use some
transformer-based model (not LLM).
-  Train the animal classification model on your dataset.
-  Build a pipeline that takes as inputs the text message and the image.


## General requirements for the test:
- The source code should be written in Python 3.
- The code should be clear for understanding and well-commented.
- All solutions should be put into the GitHub repository. Each task should:
  - be in a separate folder.
  - contain its own readme file with a solution explanation and details on how to set
  up the project.
  - requirements.txt with all libraries used in the solution.
- All the documentation, comments, and other text information around the project should
  be written in English. 
- Demo that should be represented like a Jupyter Notebook and contain examples of
  how your solution is working including a description of the edge cases.
